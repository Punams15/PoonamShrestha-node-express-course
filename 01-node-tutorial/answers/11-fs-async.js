//__dirname → the folder where your current JS file is located.

//"temporary" → folder name inside your project.

//"fileB.txt" → file name.

//Result: filePath now contains the full path to the file, like:

//Summary of what happens

//File fileB.txt is created inside temporary (if it exists).

//"Sun" is written first.

//"Moon" is appended next.

//"Stars" is appended last.

//Console logs track each step.

//Final fileB.txt content:

//Sun
//Moon
//Stars
