//__dirname = the folder your current file is in.

//path.sep → what kind of slash your computer uses for folders.

//path.join(...) → sticks folders and file names together safely.

//path.basename(...) → gives just the file name, not the folders.

//path.resolve(...) → tells you the full address of a file on your computer.
